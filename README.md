# Smart-Trashcan-with-Plastic-Detection
An Arduino-based smart trashcan that detects plastic materials and opens the lid only when plastic is detected and the bin is not full. The system uses an IR sensor for plastic detection, ultrasonic sensors to measure object distance and bin fullness, and a stepper motor to open or close the lid.
